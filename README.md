FruitVeg Freshness
The project scope is limited to freshness detection of 3 fruits (Apple, Orange and Banana) and 3
vegetables (Cucumber, Tomato, Lemon). Moreover, scope of the project includes collection of images
dataset of fruits and vegetables. These images would be preprocessed and placed in directories based
on their freshness level. We’ll develop a deep learning model for classification of fruits and vegetables
either as fresh, mild rotten or rotten by training on the gathered dataset i.e. it is a multi-class problem.
An android application would be developed that’ll allow the user to take images of fruits and vegetables.
These images would be forwarded to the remote server on which the classification deep learning CNN model based on VGG-16 architecture would have
been deployed and the model would predict the class of the forwarded image as fresh, medium fresh or
rotten. This result would be presented to the user. However, the user has-to manually select the type of
fruit or vegetable before sending the image to the server.
